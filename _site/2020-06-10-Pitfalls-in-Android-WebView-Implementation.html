<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>In the current era of hybrid mobile architecture, WebView is extensively used hand in hand to deliver dynamic web content.</p>

<p>In this blog, I will be explaining the WebView pitfalls among different Android versions.</p>

<p>This thought of writing on WebView came when one of my colleagues reported some design issues for Android Kitkat and lower versions.</p>

<p>So I tried to understand why WebView is behaving differently in different OS versions. Then while reading about them, I found some other inconsistencies. So thought of sharing that through a blog.</p>

<p>Before going into much detail, lets first understand the term <b>WebView</b>.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-android-webview">What is Android WebView?</h3>

<p><b>WebView</b> is an Android provided View like <b>TextView, EditText, Button etc</b>.</p>

<p>By using WebView, we can load the web(Html) pages as a part of our activity layout.</p>

<p>It uses <b>Webkit rendering engine</b> to display web pages and includes methods to navigate forward and backwards through a history, zoom in and out, perform text searches and more.</p>

<p>To learn more about WebView, read this <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView">document</a>.</p>

<p>Now, letâ€™s talk about the pitfalls:</p>

<h3 id="1-no-webview-update-in-kitkat-and-lower-versions">1) No WebView update in Kitkat and lower versions</h3>

<p>1) In older versions of Android (4.3 and below), WebView uses code based on Appleâ€™s Webkit â€” the same tech behind the Safari browser.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/half-of-all-android-devices-still-vulnerable-to-privacy-disaster-browser-bug/">vulnerability</a> was discovered in the WebView tool that affects anyone using Android 4.3 or earlier.</p>

<p>This vulnerability allows WebView to be exploited. When the vulnerability was reported, Google decided it would leave the patching of the 4.3 and earlier releases up to someone else(<a href="https://us.nuumobile.com/android-oems-vs-odms-5-things-you-should-know/">OEMs</a>).</p>

<p>Google fixed the Jelly Bean WebView issue with Android 4.4 KitKat patch.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The WebView shipped with <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-kitkat">Android 4.4</a> (KitKat) is based on the same code as Chrome(which uses Googleâ€™s Blink engine) for Android version 30. This WebView does not have full feature parity with Chrome for Android and is given the version number 30.0.0.0.</li>
</ul>

<p>The updated WebView shipped with Android 4.4.3 has the version number <b>33.0.0.0</b>.</p>

<p>Then came a design issue in <b>Android KitKat</b> that left the OS exposed to newly-disclosed bugs in the <b>Chromium</b> project. Android 5.0 was released with WebView updates to fix it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In all versions of Android(KitKat and below), WebView has been bundled with Android firmware. From a security standpoint, that wasnâ€™t good, because if a new flaw was found in WebView, the only way a fix would reach end-users was through the unwieldy process of delivering it from Google to OEMs and carriers and finally, if ever, to the end-user.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Then In <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/lollipop">Android 5.0</a>, WebView was broken out as a separate app, presumably to allow timely updates through Google Play without requiring firmware updates to be issued. So, Now one can update WebView from Google Play.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-webview-on-android-7-and-above-doesnt-render-the-page">2) WebView on Android 7 and above doesnâ€™t render the page</h3>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>webView.setWebViewClient(new WebViewClient() {

        public void onReceivedError(WebView view, int errorCode, String description, String failingUrl) {
            //do something here
        }

        @Override
        public boolean shouldOverrideUrlLoading(WebView view, WebResourceRequest request) {
            return true;
        }
    });
    webView.loadUrl("https://google.com/");
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This code perfectly works on &lt;7.0 android version devices.</p>

<p>When you try to debug it, you will see it loads something(google URL appears in <b>shouldOverrideUrlLoading</b> method) but it shows nothing. No error logs will appear.</p>

<p>The <b>reason</b> is right here -</p>

<p>For Pre Android N,</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@Deprecated
public boolean shouldOverrideUrlLoading(WebView view, String url) {
    return false;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and this is since Android N,</p>

<p>1) @return True if the host application wants to leave the current WebView and handle the URL itself, otherwise return false.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@Override
    public boolean shouldOverrideUrlLoading(WebView view, WebResourceRequest request) {
        return true;
    }
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Solution -</p>

<p>Returning <b>false</b> from your code will solve your problem ðŸ˜ƒ.</p>

<h3 id="3-failed-to-load-webview-provider-no-webview-installed-android-internal-crash">3) Failed to load WebView provider: No WebView installed (Android Internal crash).</h3>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Caused by android.util.AndroidRuntimeException:
android.webkit.WebViewFactory$MissingWebViewPackageException:
Failed to load WebView provider: No WebView installed
at android.webkit.WebViewFactory.getProviderClass(WebViewFactory.java:371)

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This problem seems to be happening in Lenovo, Oneplus, Samsung, Motorola, Xiaomi etc.(Non-rooted Android 5 and above devices).</p>

<p>Itâ€™s very hard to believe that such devices donâ€™t have WebView installed.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s what I discovered while digging the <b>reason</b> for this issue:</p>

<p>As we know that WebView has been shipping as a separate app from android 5.0,<b> at the time view is being inflated, the WebView package is being updated by the OS and therefore it canâ€™t find the WebView package for those few moments</b>.</p>

<p>People on the GitHub bug tracker said chrome and android were not going to fix this because itâ€™s normal behaviour and up to the developer to handle it.</p>

<p>So hereâ€™s a hacky solution that prevents crashes (You can catch the specific exception too):</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>try {
        // the inflating code that's causing the crash

    } catch (Exception e) {
        if (e.getMessage() != null &amp;&amp; e.getMessage().contains("webview")) {
            // If the system failed to inflate this view because of the WebView (which could
            // be one of several types of exceptions), it likely means that the system WebView
            // is either not present (unlikely) OR in the process of being updated (also unlikely).
            // It's unlikely but we have been receiving a lot of crashes.
            // In this case, show the user a message and finish the activity
        }
  }
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So next time when the user opens the app, probably they wonâ€™t see the crash again as WebView must be updated by then.</p>

<p>Happy Coding !!</p>
