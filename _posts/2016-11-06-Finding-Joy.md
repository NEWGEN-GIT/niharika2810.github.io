title: Absolute Joy

The Joy of producing stuff far exceeds the joy of everything else.

Whatever it may be.

A poem.

A program.

A song.

A dent in the universe.

A company.

A baby.

A design.

A blog post.

A policy document.

A-nything.

Entrepreneurs are mostly selfish. They crave for this pure joy. Of building.
