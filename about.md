Namaste!

I am Rhythm K. Gupta.

I am a lifelong learner of many disciplines like psychology, history and sciences. I'm currently building [Easy Eat](https://easyeat.ai) in South East Asia.

In the past, I've worked in ed-tech, fintech and crypto-tech.

I've yet to take my degree from IIT Delhi where I spent 4 years pretending to study Computer Science (I actually studied more physics & economics there & since!)
